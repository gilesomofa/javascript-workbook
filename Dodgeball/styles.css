/* each div will have ul and li which will be buttons that will inherit names of the People or draftable
playes and so on when they are clicked. Hover states will need to be placed on each button in 
each div with the appropriate message. 

For example, when I hover on a button in people, an alert should 
say "click this to move person to draftable" when clicked, the name should null in people and 
occupy place in appropriate team class

when I hover on a draftable an alert should pop up asking to click red team or blue team */
